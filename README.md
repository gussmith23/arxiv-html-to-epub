# arxiv-html-to-epub

To use this repo, you should just be able to do the following:
1. Copy the repo, but in a way that allows you to open your own issues (e.g. don't just fork it). You may need to clone it locally, manually create a new repo on GitHub, and then push to that repo.
2. Open an issue on the repo and note its number. Change the issue number environment variable in the `run.yml` workflow file as needed.
3. Submit papers via the workflow in the Actions tab. The papers should get posted as a comment on the issue.
